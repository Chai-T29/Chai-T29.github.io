Customer churn is a core component of marketing analytics and marketing-focused data science. Analyzing customer churn is crucial for shaping business strategy as it provides insights into why customers leave, allowing businesses to identify and address underlying issues, improve customer retention, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, companies can implement targeted interventions, optimize their products or services, and tailor marketing efforts to retain existing customers and attract new ones. Did this pique your interest? Then let's dive right in!

This project showcases the efficacy of various binary classification models in predicting customer churn (1 for churned, and 0 for retained). The project initially covers Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Logistic Regression (using gradient ascent and Newton's method). Additionally, we compare the efficacy of Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models from the sklearn library based on training time and performance metrics.

Here are the main questions this project aims to answer:

1.  How effective are the Logistic Regression models at predicting customer churn?
2.  What other models can we use and how do they perform compared to a simple Logistic Regression model?
3.  How well can we predict churn and what does that tell us about shaping business strategy?
